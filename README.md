#	Warnings	#
#################

#### OpenVZ Containers
--> PeerGuardian, it's not possible to install it in your OpenVZ Container.
```
Module 'xt_mark' is mandatory for PeerGuardian. Currently, I have not found solution. The subject is pending.
```
--> OpenVPN, you must follow this link BEFORE install 'MySB'.

#### You must have a swap partition for systems with less than 2GB of RAM!

	--> Your swap partition should be at least equal to your RAM.

#### If you don't know Linux ENOUGH:

	--> DO NOT use capital letters, all your usernames should be written in lowercase.
	--> DO NOT upgrade anything in your box, ask in the thread before even thinking about it.
	--> DO NOT try to reconfigure packages using other tutorials.

## How to install
Just copy and paste those commands on your terminal:
```
wget --no-check-certificate -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toulousain79/MySB/v1.0/MySB_Install.sh
bash MySB_Install.sh
```

If you lose connection during installation, restart the SSH session and run the following command:
```
screen -r MySB
```
Beware, during installation, the SSH port will be changed. If a port session 22 does not work, try with the new port that you have selected.

	* MySB_RefreshMe (refresh some parts of MySB)
	* MySB_UpgradeMe (to migrate to a new version of MySB)
	* MySB_UpgradeSystem (simply upgrade your system APT upgrade)

#### While executing them, if sudo is needed, they will ask for a password.

```
https://<Server IP or Server Name>:<https NginX port>/MySB/seedboxInfo.php

## BlockList
BlockList usage (optionnal), PeerGuardian or directly via rTorrent.
Depending on your system, it is possible to use: 
* PeerGuardian

	--> By default, some list are activated. Check "/etc/pgl/blocklists.list".
	--> Many tracker sites are allowed, but only private trackers. Check "/etc/pgl/allow.p2p".

OR

* rTorrent with ipv4_filter.load

	--> By default, some list are activated. Check "/etc/MySB/inc/blocklist".
	--> All list are avaible in "/etc/MySB/scripts/in/blocklist".
	--> Comment the line with '#' if you want to exclude a list OR comment out the line with deleting '#' if you want to activate it.
	--> Example: #BLUETACK_ADS="http://....." to exclude ADS Bluetack list.	
	--> And do "bash /etc/MySB/scripts/BlockList.sh" for generate the new list for each users.
	NB: The script compile one file with all list, and make cleaning rules.
	NB: Beware, if you have not enough memory, choising too many list will make you system very slow!


## OpenVPN

To use your VPN you will need a VPN client compatible with [OpenVPN](http://openvpn.net/index.php?option=com_content&id=357), necessary files to configure your connection are in this link in your box:
```
http://<Server IP or Server Name>:<https NginX port>/MySB/OpenVPN.php` and use it in any OpenVPN client.
```
#### For OpenVZ, you must validate the prerequisites on this page first. Otherwise, OpenVPN will not be functional.
```
